        <p>
          As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
          I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.
          <span class="hl">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
          In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind,
          and I said to myself:
          <span class="quote">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
          <span class="quote">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep ..."</span>
          And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame
          that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind ...
